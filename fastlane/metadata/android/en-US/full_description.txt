Easily log work on Jira Issues.

Features:
1. See the issues you are working on right now
2. Pin issues to the top so they are always at your fingertips
3. Work logs are logged precisely
4. Work logs require a summary when you stop the timer, never forget what you were doing again
5. Summaries can be immediately logged with voice to text recognition
6. All new logs are stored locally to allow you to edit the summaries before you send them off in bulk

The issues list is created through a combination of the follow searches, and is currently not configurable:
· "issuekey in issueHistory() ORDER BY lastViewed DESC"
· "worklogAuthor=currentUser() ORDER BY lastViewed DESC"
· "assignee=currentUser() ORDER BY lastViewed DESC"
